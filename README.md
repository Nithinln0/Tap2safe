# Tap2Safe

An Android-based personal safety app that alerts your emergency contacts using GPS tracking and motion detection.

## 🔍 Overview

**Tap2Safe** is an Android application designed to ensure personal safety by leveraging the phone's accelerometer and GPS services. It monitors motion (like sudden shakes or falls) and instantly sends your real-time location to emergency contacts. This application runs in the background and is ideal for situations where users may not be able to reach their phone in time.
